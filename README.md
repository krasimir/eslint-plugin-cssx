# ESLint plugin for CSSX

Install the plugin with `npm i eslint-plugin-cssx` and add it to your `.eslintrc` file:

```json
"plugins": [
  "eslint-plugin-react"
]
```

*Note: the plugin is replacing CSSX expressions with empty object so the code becomes a valid JavaScript/JSX. It's not doing CSS linting.*
